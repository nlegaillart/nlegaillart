## Hi there 👋

You will find mainly two repositories mirrored from my private forge here:
 - [Source code](https://github.com/nlegaillart/website) of my [personal website](https://nicolas.legaillart.fr), built using various languages and deployed using CD
 - [Source code](https://github.com/nlegaillart/cv) of my [résumé](https://nicolas.legaillart.fr/cv), built using HackMyResume and uploaded to my website

Also check out my professional profiles:
 - [nlegaillart-nc](https://github.com/nlegaillart-nc)
 - [nlegaillart-dri](https://github.com/nlegaillart-dri)

Most content is in French.
